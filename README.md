# [X] The Family Hash

Create a report from a hash with a nested hash.


## Docs

* [Ruby Hashes](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.2/Hash.html)

## Instructions

- [X] Define a hash that contains information about several members of your family. 

- [X] Produce output that looks like the following example.
            ```
            Krista is my sister and is 42 years old
            ```


## Notes

-The most basic way to iterate a hash is:

    ```
    hash.each do |key, value|
        puts key
        puts value
    end
    ```
